text: The Design Walz is a nonprofit project that helps young designers and creative people to travel and work in different agencies or companies while being able to focus on their creativity rather than their financial situation. We want to build a network and community that supports everybody in the DESIGN WALZ and makes connecting Walzers and Hosts easier.
